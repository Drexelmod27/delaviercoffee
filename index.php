    <p class="wow fadeInLeft c-index__video_about">Having been a customer for years at different coffee shops I knew exactly what I was looking for but I never quite found the spot. Countless coffee shops have always either had a pleasant atmosphere with sub-par coffee or had excellent coffee with somewhat unreliable customer service. I wanted the best of both worlds, a shop where the environment was welcoming and friendly while still upholding very high standards when it came to brewing a warm cup of coffee. One day I said “enough is enough!” With this in mind I decided to create my own and this is when Delavier was born.<br> As a company we strive for only the best quality. Whether it is our coffee or even our customer service we make sure to put our customers first.
        Our coffee is freshly brewed every morning with our special house blend a long with our signature pastries ranging from cookies to homemade crumb cake. If you are looking for a more hardier meal we even have breakfast options such as avocado toast and bagels served with eggs. So next time you’re in town feel free to come in relax and taste our wonderfully made food and brewed coffee!
